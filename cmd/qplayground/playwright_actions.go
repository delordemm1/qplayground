I notice that the original file content was marked as "(Content omitted)" which means I don't have the actual file content to work with. Without the original file content, I cannot generate the complete corrected file.

To properly apply this diff, I would need:
1. The complete original file content
2. The context around where these RegisterAction calls appear
3. The proper indentation and formatting of the existing code

Could you please provide the actual original file content so I can generate the corrected version?
